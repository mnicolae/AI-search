Eight Puzzle:
  Programming:
    Misplaced tiles heuristic: 5/5
    Manhattan distance heuristic: 5/5
    Solution cost: 5/5
    Successors: 5/5

    Score: 5+5+0.5*5+0.5*5 = 15/15

  Written part:
    a: 1.00/1
    b: 1.00/1

    Score: 1.00 + 1.00 = 2.00/2

  Total: 15 + 5*2.00 = 20.00 points (out of 20)

Courier:
  Programming:
    Sum delivery costs heuristic: 24/24
    Max delivery costs heuristic: 24/24
    Successors: 24/24
    Correct solution:
      Earned: 22/22
      Load: 22/22
      Carrying: 22/22
      Unsolvable: 2/2

    Score: 24+24+24+(0.5*22+0.25*22+0.25*22+2) = 96.00/96

  Written part:
    a: 0.00/1
    b: 1.00/1
    c: 1.00/1
    d: 0.50/1
    e: 1.00/1
    f: 1.00/1

    Score: 0.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 1.00 + 1.00 = 4.50/6

  Total: (60/96)*96.00 + (20/6)*4.50 = 75.00 points (out of 80)

Grand total: 95.00 points (out of 100)

NOTES:
Eight puzzle was evaluated over 5 test cases. You were given one point for each
heuristic that correctly evaluated the state, half a point if the solution cost
found (using the null heuristic) was correct (or if the case was correctly
identified as unsolvable), and a half a point if the successors for the initial
state were correctly generated. This gives a total of 5*3=15 points for this
part. The other 5 points were assigned to the written part.

The courier domain was evaluated over 24 cases. You were given one point for
each heuristic that correctly evaluated the initial state and one point each
time the successors were correctly generated. Additionally, you were given one
point each time you correctly identified the problem as unsolvable, half a
point each time your goal state correctly reported the earnings, a quarter
point each time your goal state was carrying no jobs and another quarter if it
correctly returned a load of 0 (these last four items effectively correspond to
giving one point for every correct solution). This gives a total of 96 points
that were normalized to a range of up to 60. The remaining 20 points were
assigned to the written part.
